# FirstWebScraper

This is my first web scraper and my first time using node.js. Cheerio, express, ejs and axios are the packages I installed.
This project takes the top rated gaming desktops and laptops (based off an AMD or Intel cpu build) from best buy and displays
that information onto the web scraper. AMD, Intel, AMD desktops, AMD laptops, Intel desktops and Intel laptops are links that
the user can click while browsing the home page. The user will receive said information based off the link that they click. 
The hardest part about this project was figuring out how to use ejs. View FirstAPI.js, ResultPage.ejs, WSHomePage.ejs and WSHomePage.css for the source code. WSHomePage.css is located inside public/css. ResultPage.ejs and WSHomePage.ejs is located
inside the views folder.
